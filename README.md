# AI Career Learning Journal ðŸ““

Welcome to my AI transition journal! I'm documenting my learning path from healthcare operations executive to AI Product / Data Strategy hybrid. This repo will track my:
- Key takeaways from AI courses
- Project plans
- Reflections
- Industry use cases

## ðŸ§  Week 1: AI for Everyone â€“ Andrew Ng
- What I learned:
  - AI is more about strategy and use cases than deep coding
  - Focus on value creation, not just model accuracy
